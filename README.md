Blackjack is a card game played between a dealer and one or more players. 
The objective of the game is to have a hand value of 21 or as close to 21 as 
possible, without going over.

Here's a rundown of the basic rules:

The game is played with one or more decks of standard playing cards.

The cards are ranked as follows: Ace can be worth either 1 or 11, face cards 
(King, Queen, Jack) are worth 10, and all other cards are worth their face value.

The game begins with each player receiving two cards and the dealer receiving one
card face up and one card face down.

The player can choose to "hit" (take another card) or "stand" (keep their current hand). 
The player continues to hit until they either have a hand value of 21 or over, or they choose to stand.

If the player goes over 21, they "bust" and lose the game.

After the player has finished their turn, the dealer reveals their face-down card and hits or stands according 
to a set of rules. In most versions of Blackjack, the dealer must hit until their hand value is at least 17.

If the dealer busts, all remaining players win.

If neither the player nor the dealer busts, the hand with the highest value less than or equal to 21 wins.

A "Blackjack" is a hand that consists of an Ace and any 10-point card (10, Jack, Queen, King). 
Blackjacks pay out at 3:2 odds, unless the dealer also has a Blackjack, in which case the game is a 
"push" (tie) and the player's bet is returned.
